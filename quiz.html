She was accompanied by an experienced ski instructor who immediately called the ski patrol. She did not show any visible sign of injury but the ski patrol followed strict procedures and brought her back to the bottom of the slope and insisted she should see a doctor. She appeared fine, joked about the fall and a slight headache, but declined seeing a doctor.  An ambulance arrived at 1 p.m. and transported the patient from the foot of the mountain to the infirmary by sleigh.  The patient thought she was fine and didn't want to stay at the infirmary. At 1:10 p.m., the patient signed hospital waiver paperwork and walked 300 yards to her hotel along with her ski instructor. She was back in her room by 1:30 p.m. The ski instructor stayed with her at her hotel. Approximately an hour after the incident the patient was nauseated, feeling light headed, and confused.
